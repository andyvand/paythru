<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>The goal of ${sitename} is to foster Bitcoin adoption through increased use and public awareness. ${sitename} takes the approach that a <abbr title="Universal Resource Indiciator" class="initialism">URI</abbr> can act as its own authority and "publish" a Bitcoin address. By connecting those published addresses into a single, simple interface, ${sitename} can serve as an internet bitcoin directory. If we know the Bitcoin address for a URI (either through a <a href="/about#publishingmethods">published protocol</a> or claimed through proof-of-control), we'll report it. If not, ${sitename} will generate a deposit address to collect funds until the receiver claims them. <em>An account balance must be at least enough to cover the network fee (0.0001 BTC) before funds can be sent.</em></p>

<h4>How does the person know I sent them money?</h4>
<p>Currently, ${sitename} uses email as the sole notification mechanism, however, I'm planning to add other services such as Twitter and SMS.</p>

<h4>What happens if no one claims the funds I sent?</h4>
<p>There is a 2016 block (configurable) limit which will trigger a refund to the first address on the "input" to the transaction. More specifically, the "input" is the previous transaction's outputs, so non-simple transactions may not work as expected. It's not perfect, but it's the best that can be done with the current protocol. <em>It would be much preferrable if the person publishes thier own Bitcoin address :)</em></p>

<h4>Are there fees?</h4>
<p>${sitename} charges no fees, although we deduct 0.0001 BTC when forwarding funds to encourage timely processing by the network. This is standard in many clients and can be adjusted as needed. <em>Because of the network fee, account balances must be greater than the fee to forward. The account balance can be seen on the blockchain.</em></p>

<h4>This is new, how can I trust it?</h4>
<p>Trust is built over time, so I hope the Bitcoin community finds this useful and <a href="/developers" title="${sitename} / Developers">builds off of it</a>. Until then, all I can suggest is that you go out and try it. Send a few bitcents to your friends; we'll handle the notification. Or register your website with a <a href="/about#publishingmethods">supported publishing method</a>. We'll pick that up and ${sitename} will report it dutifully. Once your Bitcoin address is published, ${sitename} can't even touch the transaction.
</p>

<h4>What happens if someone sends Bitcoins to old Bitcoin address?</h4>
<p>If funds are sent to the old ${sitename}-generated address even after you've published your Bitcoin address, we'll attempt to forward that transaction to the published address. As mentioned elsewhere, the balance must be <em>more than</em> the fee of 0.0001 BTC</p>

<h4>There are bitcoins stuck at the temporary ${sitename} deposit address!</h4>
<p>A single confirmation is required for funds to be forwarded. Additionally, if funds are sent to the old ${sitename}-generated address even after you've claimed your URI, we'll attempt to forward the transaction. If funds are STILL stuck at an old address for any reason, re-claiming your URI (even to your own same address) should re-trigger the sweep functionality out of our wallet and into yours. If none of these unstick it for you, please contact me for manual processing (and bug hunting!)</p>

<h4>What's stopping you from disappearing with all the uncollected funds?</h4>
