<p>Someone is trying to re-claim your page at <a href="http://${hostname}/${po.uri}">${hostname}/${po.uri}</a>. This might just be you updating a <a href="http://${hostname}/about#published-methods">publishing method</a>.
$if authcode:
	In case you need a new authcode, here's a handy link prefilled to your <a href="http://${hostname}/${po.uri}${authstring}">claim page</a>. The code itself is ${authcode}.
$else:
	If any funds were held by our servers, they have been sent to your published address, <samp>${po.address}</samp>.
At any time, you can always update the Bitcoin address or re-claim funds by using the re-claim button at the bottom of <a href="http://${hostname}/${po.uri}">your page</a>.
